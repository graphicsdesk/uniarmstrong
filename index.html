            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The presidency of a University squarely in the center of the tensions roiling college campuses since Oct. 7, 2023, seems far from a dream job.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But Katrina Armstrong, the Columbia University Irving Medical Center’s chief executive officer and Columbia’s new interim president, has signed on to succeed Minouche Shafik, whose tenure was embroiled by student protests, congressional scrutiny, and backlash over administrative decision-making.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Although her career in leadership at universities and hospitals spans decades, Armstrong, the first woman to lead the medical center and Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, is relatively new to the University. With only two years at Columbia under her belt, Armstrong brings a blank slate and a legacy marked by distinguished research and leadership at a highly-ranked medical school.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The most significant controversy she has faced in her tenure was criticism over the University and medical center’s handling of the case involving former medical center gynecologist Robert Hadden, who was convicted on federal charges of sexually abusing patients for two decades. It was a serious issue passed down to her by previous leadership, much like those she has inherited from Shafik.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Even then, Armstrong led the medical center as it <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/11/13/columbia-failed-these-survivors-university-to-notify-former-patients-of-hadden-abuses-launch-third-party-investigation/">moved</a> to address the harm inflicted on Hadden’s patients and establish preventive measures against future abuse.

</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Armstrong wrote in her first email to the Columbia community as interim president on Wednesday that she is “acutely aware of the trials the University has faced over the past year.” As an administrator, she has <a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/our-sense-shared-purpose">delivered remarks</a> on antisemitism, Oct. 7, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  On Friday, she <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/08/16/we-must-take-care-to-bridge-divides-armstrong-issues-statement-to-columbia-community/">issued another statement</a> urging Columbia to “recalibrate as a community” while “bearing in mind the challenges of the past year and those to come, but not allowing them to define us.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We must take care to bridge divides,” she wrote.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  What remains to be seen, however, is how Armstrong will rebuild a fractured University with a new vision for Columbia while carrying the baggage of Shafik’s presidency—and, how long she will be tasked with steering it.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>The interim presidency</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Armstrong is the first person in Columbia’s history to hold the title of interim president, although there have been two acting presidents, Frank D. Fackenthal from 1945 to 1948 and Andrew W. Cordier from 1968 to 1969, and one president pro tempore, Benjamin Moore from 1775 to 1776.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  All these presidents stepped in during or directly after major wars: Moore amid the American Revolutionary War, Fackenthal after World War II, and Cordier during the Vietnam War. Cordier stepped in after Grayson Kirk resigned following the upheaval of the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/sports/2022/02/15/gym-crow-looking-back-on-the-1968-morningside-gym-protests/">1968 protests</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While historically rare for Columbia, Armstrong’s appointment follows a recent trend among the Ivy League, which has seen three other interim presidents in the past year.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  University of Pennsylvania’s Larry Jameson and Harvard University’s Alan Garber both became interim presidents after the universities’ respective leaders, Liz Magill and Claudine Gay, stepped down after struggling to respond to intense questioning about antisemitism at a Dec. 5, 2023, congressional hearing. Months later, Cornell University <a href="https://cornellsun.com/2024/05/09/breaking-president-pollack-to-retire-after-seven-years-of-leadership/">tapped Michael Kotlikoff</a> as its interim president following the retirement of Martha Pollack.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Armstrong joins her fellow interim presidents in hailing from her institution’s medical school, although she is the only woman among her interim peers. Prior to the past months of leadership shakeup, women leaders oversaw six out of eight Ivy League universities. Now, that number is down to four.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Earlier this summer, the <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/06/penn-interim-president-jameson-to-serve-until-2026-presidential-search">University of Pennsylvania announced</a> Jameson would remain as interim president through at least 2026, or until a successor is found. At Harvard, Garber became the <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/8/3/alan-garber-confirmed-harvard-31st-president/">university’s 31st president</a> two weeks ago and will hold the position until the end of the 2026-27 academic year. Neither university has officially launched its presidential search.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Similarly, Columbia has yet to release any information regarding a search for Shafik’s permanent replacement. Columbia’s <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/10/05/trustees-hope-to-finish-presidential-search-by-january/">last presidential search</a> took roughly seven months from the day the board of trustees <a href="https://secretary.columbia.edu/news/members-presidential-search-committee-are-announced">launched</a> the presidential search committee in June 2022 to the day the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/01/18/nemat-minouche-shafik-to-lead-columbia-as-20th-university-president/">University announced Shafik</a> as the 20th president in January 2023. Former University President Lee Bollinger had said <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/04/14/after-two-decades-as-president-bollinger-to-step-down-in-2023/">he was stepping down</a> in April 2022.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>New community initiatives</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As Armstrong takes the helm, she will be tasked with overseeing Shafik’s <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/07/24/shafik-announces-ongoing-community-initiatives-new-orientation-resources-for-first-year-students-set-to-begin-in-the-fall/">ongoing community initiatives</a> designed to tackle concerns over academic freedom, staff needs, and Columbia’s long-existing protest rules.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The list of initiatives, which Shafik outlined in a July 24 email to the Columbia community, placed emphasis on surveying opinion from the University’s faculty, staff, and student constituencies, although in broad terms and with little detail on concrete steps to help bridge divides. Shafik wrote that Chief Operating Officer Cas Holloway is working to “build our capacity to better understand the concerns and feelings of our workforce,” and Executive Vice President for University Life Dennis Mitchell has met with students over the summer to solicit feedback.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the email, Shafik also wrote that University Provost Angela Olinto has been “working with each of our deans to set up faculty working groups focused on sustaining academic freedom and free speech in a community free of discrimination and bias.” She added that these bodies will be “essential” in educating future leaders—a sentiment Armstrong echoed in her Wednesday email to the community.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You are the ultimate keepers of the institution’s values and the stewards of its long and proud history,” Armstrong wrote of the University’s faculty. “The habit of critical thinking and humility that gives birth to tolerance of contrary points of view is the most essential lesson taught in Columbia’s classrooms.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Another one of Shafik’s initiatives makes a nod to the concerns raised by student protesters, such as breakdowns in “good faith engagement.” She wrote that the University asked two faculty from the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program at the School of Professional Studies to work with affected students toward mediated outcomes, which Armstrong—without the blame for April’s two police sweeps—will be key in upholding.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Negotiations between Columbia’s administration and protesters in the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” collapsed in April after students declined the University’s offers and <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/29/columbia-will-not-divest-from-israel-negotiators-fail-to-come-to-agreement-shafik-announces/">Shafik announced</a> that Columbia “will not divest from Israel.” Pro-Palestinian students have indicated they will continue in the fall to demand divestment from all companies with ties to Israel and cancellation of the opening of the Tel Aviv Global Center, leaving Armstrong with the challenging task of balancing clashing concerns over the handling of future protests.
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Shafik’s departure and Armstrong’s appointment mark Columbia’s most stunning administrative change within the past year, but they followed a semester of administrative turnover that extended across the University.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In January, Columbia <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/01/30/cas-holloway-named-columbias-first-chief-operating-officer/">hired</a> Holloway, the University’s first-ever chief operating officer and a now key administrative figure in the University’s attempts to discipline students who it identifies as participating in unauthorized demonstrations or events.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As interim president, Armstrong will serve as the presiding officer of the University Senate and sit on its executive committee. The University Senate is a governing body composed of members of Columbia’s seven constituencies: faculty, administrative staff, students, administrators, librarians, research officers, and alumni.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During Shafik’s presidency, she attended only a few of the senate’s monthly plenary sessions, raising concerns from senators. The next senate plenary is scheduled for Friday, Aug. 23, although it remains unclear whether Armstrong will attend.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The University Senate’s Rules of University Conduct were brushed aside for much of the spring semester as Columbia <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/02/19/columbia-establishes-demonstration-areas-and-times-alters-disciplinary-procedure-for-students-in-violation-of-new-event-policy/">introduced</a> its interim policy for safe demonstrations in February, which <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/02/26/shafik-university-senators-weigh-in-on-new-interim-demonstration-policy/">generated</a> immediate backlash from members of the University Senate. The policy is subject to review and revision, though no changes have been made public despite the policy being in place for almost six months.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Rules of University Conduct—which are codified in the University Statutes and have existed since the 1968 protests—are also undergoing their own review and revision through the University Senate.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Armstrong will also have to contend with Columbia’s proposal to add “peace officers” to Columbia’s security personnel, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-looks-to-give-campus-police-arresting-power-after-protests-11d2b3bc">reported</a> by the Wall Street Journal. Columbia currently has around 290 security personnel, according to the Journal. While sources told the Journal the proposal is still in its early stages, they said the officers could be granted the authority to arrest students.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator that Columbia is undergoing a process of internal and external consultations with other universities to prepare “for a range of scenarios that may arise.” The spokesperson did not confirm nor deny the basis of the Journal’s report.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We are looking at various ways to supplement our public safety capabilities,” the spokesperson wrote. “We seek to strengthen the department’s skills and training in de-escalation techniques, expanding the department’s ability to manage a range of incident[s] while taking into account the fact Columbia does not have its own police force, as many peer institutions have, and potentially reducing our reliance on the NYPD.”

  The Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/03/05/advisory-committee-on-socially-responsible-investing-rejects-cuad-divestment-proposal/">rejected in February</a> a proposal from Columbia University Apartheid Divest, titled “Divestment from Israeli Apartheid, Occupation, and Genocide,” on the basis of failing to meet the criteria for consideration of divestment. The proposal cited investments in companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, and an exchange-traded fund managed by BlackRock—all of which have operations in Israel.

  Shafik’s administration had offered to protesters that Columbia develop an “expedited timeline” for divestment proposals submitted to the committee for review and establish a process by which students can access a list of Columbia’s direct investment holdings, although neither offer moved forward when negotiations <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/24/cuad-negotiators-leave-talks-as-shafiks-midnight-deadline-passes/">fell through</a> the night of April 23.

  Should Armstrong enter negotiations again with protesters, she will have to weigh the pros and cons of previous offers and proposals, both from students and the University.

  In every decision she makes, Armstrong will have to weigh the donor response. Many donors, such as <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/22/robert-kraft-cc-63-trustee-emeritus-announces-he-is-not-comfortable-supporting-columbia-until-protests-end/">Robert Kraft</a>, CC ’63, have pulled their funding from Columbia as a show of disagreement with the way the administration handled the crisis on campus. Columbia also indefinitely <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/10/23/columbia-postpones-annual-giving-day-citing-not-the-appropriate-time/">postponed</a> last year’s Giving Day—the annual 24-hour online fundraising initiative that usually takes place in October—for the first time in the event’s 12-year history.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Other Ivy League schools have also seen their donors retract funding as a result of ongoing campus activism and administrative decision-making. Harvard’s gift officers became increasingly worried that longtime donors would stop giving money over concerns regarding antisemitism on campus, the Harvard Crimson <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/11/29/donor-backlash-israel-hamas-response/">reported</a> in November, and the Daily Pennsylvanian <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2023/11/penn-who-are-the-withdrawn-donors">reported</a> that dozens of alumni pulled their funding around the same time.

  A contentious aspect of <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/05/17/bollinger-bids-farewell-to-presidency-after-21-years-at-columbia/">Bollinger’s legacy</a>, Columbia’s Manhattanville campus expansion, became much less of a focus of criticism for Shafik despite construction continuing into its second phase, which is set to conclude in 2030. Still, in June, West Harlem leaders and students gathered for a “<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2024/06/26/harlem-politicians-community-advocates-announce-support-for-bill-to-halt-columbias-expansion-projects-at-juneteenth-rally-for-housing-justice/">Juneteenth Rally for Housing Justice</a>” in support of a State Senate bill that would immediately halt Columbia’s expansion into Harlem. One of the rally’s co-sponsors was SJP.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The bill is <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S9028/amendment/A">still in the early stages</a> and may see further developments throughout Armstrong’s tenure.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Another issue left unresolved by Bollinger and Shafik is the potential <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/05/25/after-months-of-contention-arts-and-sciences-faculty-endorse-restructuring-proposals/">restructuring</a> and <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/09/12/undergraduate-expansion-postponed-as-arts-and-sciences-looks-toward-improvement/">expansion</a> of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the budgetary unit encompassing five schools: Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the School of Professional Studies, the Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences, and the School of the Arts.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Restructuring efforts, which Bollinger set out to explore by creating a task force in September 2021, attempted to deal with questions about the administration of the Arts and Sciences. Much of the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/05/10/pushback-mounts-ahead-of-restructuring-vote/">debate</a> surrounded the budgetary relationship between Columbia College and FAS, with concerns over the discrepancy in fundraising between Columbia College and the Arts and Sciences as a whole.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As part of an effort to bring in more funding, FAS launched an inquiry in 2021 into potentially increasing the number of undergraduate students. The plan was postponed in September 2022 until fall or spring 2025 to coincide with the completion of renovations to <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/11/04/faculty-of-arts-and-sciences-plans-renovations-departmental-transfers-for-uris-hall/">Uris Hall</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, as a result of the Arts and Sciences’ continued funding issues, the University has not begun construction on Uris and will likely see an extension to the project’s timeline. Armstrong may have to help decide the future of the project as it lays stagnant.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  FAS <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/05/16/faculty-of-arts-and-sciences-passes-vote-of-no-confidence-in-shafik/">passed a vote of no confidence</a> in Shafik that was announced on May 16, with 65 percent of participating faculty members voting in favor. The vote was brought to the faculty by the Columbia of the American Association of University Professors, which expressed concerns about the state of shared governance and academic freedom at Columbia as well as the disciplinary proceedings mounted this past semester.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Now, Armstrong will have to face the outspoken criticisms from the past academic year head-on, and assuming her tenure extends to 2025 or beyond, possibly decide the future of expansion, restructuring, and renovations to Uris.
</p>

  <b>A fresh start</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Shafik’s resignation largely came as a <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/08/16/columbia-faculty-express-shock-over-shafiks-resignation-cautious-optimism-for-armstrong/">surprise</a> to the community, especially after she weathered the spring semester without backing out of her role during a comparably quiet summer. But, her timing dodged the potential chaos of undergoing a presidential change in the middle of an academic year, which occurred at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As Armstrong inherits a mountain of pressing issues left by Shafik concerning the University’s standing in higher education and the nation at large, the community will watch to see how she makes her mark as a new leader in a time when all eyes are on Columbia.
